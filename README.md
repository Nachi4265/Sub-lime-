#Sub-Lime Sandwich Shop Capstone

##Description
This project is the point of sales application for Sub-lime , a custom sandwich 
shop. Currently at Sub-lime our customers can fully customize their sandwich

currently taking all orders on paper. But our business is growing, and we need a 
way to automate the order process (and eventually even make it available 
online).
